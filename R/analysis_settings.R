# Modified version of addPathwaySettings from TreatmentPatterns

#' Function to create analysis settings for drug utilization
#'
#' This function adopts ideas from TreatmentPatterns::addPathwayAnalysis and
#' builds the settings needed for a drug utilization study.
#'
#' @param database identify the database for the analysis
#' @param studyName provide a study name defaults to main
#' @param targetCohortId the ids for the target cohort
#' @param targetCohortName the name of the target cohort
#' @param eventCohortIds the ids for the event cohorts
#' @param eventCohortNames the names for the event cohorts
#' @param includeTreatments Include treatments starting ('startDate') or ending ('endDate') after target cohort start date
#' @param periodPriorToIndex 	Number of days prior to the index date of the target cohort that event cohorts are allowed to start
#' @param minEraDuration Minimum time an event era should last to be included in analysis
#' @param eraCollapseSize Window of time between which two eras of the same event cohort are collapsed into one era
#' @param combinationWindow 	Window of time two event cohorts need to overlap to be considered a combination treatment
#' @param minPostCombinationDuration 	Minimum time an event era before or after a generated combination treatment should last to be included in analysis
#' @param filterTreatments 	Select first occurrence of ("First") / changes between ("Changes') / all event cohorts ("All")
#' @param maxPathLength Maximum number of steps included in treatment pathway (max 5)
#' @param minCellCount Minimum number of persons with a specific treatment pathway for the pathway to be included in analysis
#' @param minCellMethod Select to completely remove / sequentially adjust (by removing last step as often as necessary) treatment pathways below minCellCount
#' @param groupCombinations Select to group all non-fixed combinations in one category 'otherâ€™ in the sunburst plot
#' @param addNoPaths Select to include untreated persons without treatment pathway in the sunburst plot
#' @param outputFolder the outputfolder to save data to csv
#' @return a DrugUtilizationAnalysisSettings object defining the treatment analysis
#' @export
